# Computational Physics Y0338

This is the repository where I keep the code I wrote during my time as a student at the [UoA Dept. of Physics](www.phys.uoa.gr) and specifically for the course of Computational Physics.

## Structure
As should be obvious, the repository has two folders, one with the exercises and one with the solutions to these exercises. There's also an exam and the solutions to that exam.

## Updates
July 2020 - Started re-writting the code from scratch, since it was both too ugly/bloated, and also because I wanted to use this opportunity to study for the course, the exam of which I will hopefully pass.
